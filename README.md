# Salonix - A Full-featured Salon Booking System for Cross-platform applications

This repository will serve as the backend providing REST resources to the frontend of the application and can be extended to any other application.

## About the Project

As part of my building my skills in building full stack applications on native applications (Currently Android - using Expo Go Framework). I'm building Salonix (Just after building Quotix - which I used as a hands-on project to improve my knowledge of mobile development) - This is the Codebase for the Backend.
